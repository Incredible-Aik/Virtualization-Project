# 🧪 Virtualization Project – Ubuntu Deployment with Penguin Game

## 🎯 Overview

This was a group-based school project focused on **virtualization**. Our objective was to create a fully functional **virtual machine**, install an operating system of our choice, and deploy an application within that environment.

We chose to install **Ubuntu OS** and deployed a simple **penguin shooting game** as our application. This project allowed us to understand the fundamentals of virtual machines, OS installation, and collaborative tech workflows.
